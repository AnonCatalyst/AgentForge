## Detailed Description:

**AgentForge** was developed to address the need for an efficient, transparent, and high-performance tool for generating valid user agents at scale. Often used in web scraping, SEO analysis, penetration testing, or browsing automation, user agents are critical for maintaining anonymity, mimicking real user activity, and avoiding detection by websites' anti-bot measures.

With AgentForge, users can generate user agents in bulk, validate them in real-time, and save them for future use. The tool performs efficient batch processing, validating each user agent by checking whether it is accepted by a live site. The real-time feedback provided in the form of a status table allows users to track the progress of the generation and validation process without the need to manually verify each user agent.

Users can also customize the number of user agents to generate, making the tool adaptable to both small-scale testing and large-scale operations. Additionally, AgentForge displays important details such as the file size of the output and the directory path where the user agents are saved, providing greater transparency and control over the process.

With the ability to simulate real-world behavior by generating user agents across various devices and browsers, AgentForge is ideal for web scraping operations that require diverse, non-repetitive user agents. The tool also ensures that the generated user agents are always validated before use, providing users with reliable, error-free data.
